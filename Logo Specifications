I am working with a non-profit organization that needs a logo. The idea behind the logo is to use an upright triangle that includes a pine tree (Jeffrey or Ponderosa) and one bird - Clark's nuthatch or hermit warbler. The bird can be in or overlap the triangle. The name of the organization is "San Bernardino Bird Conservancy".

The preferred color palette is natural colors such as green, brown, and yellow (e.g., forest). The font style can be similar to the other logo for reference in that the edges are softer/rounded.
